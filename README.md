# QuizSpeech

## Project Description
QuizSpeech is a web application that allows users to create, search, update, and delete quizes and questions.
It uses an authentication system to verify users and routes.
It allows users to hear aloud the quiz questions and answers

## Motivation
I created this website for my mother to help her study for a citizenship test,
she is also learning english so the speak aloud feature is helpful
